# ComplexityLens

A simple, plain, and lightweight VS Code plugin to check code complexity in TypeScript and JavaScript files. No fancy stuff‚Äîjust a straightforward tool to help you identify complex functions and manage code quality with full customization over how complexity is displayed.

## Overview

ComplexityLens calculates the **cyclomatic complexity** of functions in your TypeScript and JavaScript code and displays the "Risk" level directly in the editor. It uses customizable icons, colors, and messages to indicate whether a function's complexity is within acceptable limits, warrants a warning, or signals an error based on user-defined thresholds. With complete control over all settings, you can tailor the plugin to fit your team's coding standards.

- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and no unnecessary features.
- **Simple**: Displays complexity with basic icons (‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚ùå) and color-coded text.
- **Fully Customizable**: Adjust thresholds, messages, colors, and icons to match your preferences.
- **Focused**: Works only with TypeScript and JavaScript files, targeting function complexity.

## Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
3. Search for **ComplexityLens**.
4. Click **Install**.
5. Reload VS Code if prompted.

## Usage

Once activated, ComplexityLens automatically analyzes your TypeScript and JavaScript files and displays the complexity of each function in the editor. The complexity is shown above each function with an icon and a risk score:

- ‚úÖ **(Green)**: Complexity is below the warning threshold (low risk).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **(Orange)**: Complexity is between the warning and error thresholds (moderate risk).
- ‚ùå **(Red)**: Complexity exceeds the error threshold (high risk).

### Customizing Settings

ComplexityLens offers **full customization** through a dedicated configuration panel, giving you control over every aspect of how complexity is displayed:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type `ComplexityLens: Configure Thresholds and Styles` and select it.
3. The configuration panel will open, allowing you to adjust:
   - **Threshold Settings**:
     - **Warning Threshold**: Set the complexity level for warnings (default: 10).
     - **Error Threshold**: Set the complexity level for errors (default: 15).
   - **Message Settings**:
     - **Low Complexity Message**: Customize the message for low-risk functions (default: "Risk").
     - **Warning Complexity Message**: Customize the message for warning-level functions (default: "Risk").
     - **Error Complexity Message**: Customize the message for error-level functions (default: "Risk").
   - **Color and Icon Settings**:
     - **Low Complexity Color/Icon**: Set the color (e.g., "green", "#00FF00") and icon (e.g., ‚úÖ) for low-risk functions.
     - **Warning Complexity Color/Icon**: Set the color (e.g., "orange", "#FFA500") and icon (e.g., ‚ö†Ô∏è) for warning-level functions.
     - **Error Complexity Color/Icon**: Set the color (e.g., "red", "#FF0000") and icon (e.g., ‚ùå) for error-level functions.
4. Click **Save** to apply changes or **Reset to Default** to revert to default settings.

You can also fine-tune settings via VS Code‚Äôs Settings UI (`Ctrl+,` or `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`) by searching for `ComplexityLens`.

### Toggling the Plugin

You can enable or disable ComplexityLens using the command palette:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type `ComplexityLens: Toggle` and select it.
3. A message will confirm whether the plugin is enabled or disabled.

## How Complexity is Calculated

ComplexityLens uses **cyclomatic complexity**, which starts at `1` for each function and increments by `1` for each of the following:

- Control flow statements (`if`, `for`, `while`, `do`, `switch`, etc.).
- Conditional expressions (ternary operators).
- Logical binary expressions (`&&`, `||`).

This metric helps you identify functions that might be too complex and need refactoring.

## Supported Languages

- TypeScript
- JavaScript

## Limitations

- Only works with TypeScript and JavaScript files.
- Does not support other languages (e.g., Python, Java).
- Complexity is calculated for functions only, not for other constructs like classes or modules.
